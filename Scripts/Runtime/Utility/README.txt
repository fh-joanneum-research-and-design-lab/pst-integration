Simple implementation of a circular buffer in C#.
This is a single file implementation, which means that you only need to copy 
the CircularBuffer.cs file to your project and use it.

What is a circular buffer? 

"A circular buffer, cyclic buffer or ring buffer is a data structure 
that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end."
This means that you have predefined memory usage. Push and Pop operations 
are always O(1). Index access is also O(1).
